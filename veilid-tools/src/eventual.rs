/// Eventual is like Dart's "Completer"
/// It is a thread-safe concurrent data future that may eventually resolve to a value
/// Three variants exist
/// Eventual, which will complete each 'instance' future to that instance's value (can be different per instance) only when 'resolve' is called.
/// EventualValue, which will complete each 'instance' future when 'resolve' is called with an owned value, and one of those instances may 'take' the value.
/// EventualValueClone, which will complete each 'instance' future when 'resolve' is called with a Clone-able value, and any of those instances may get a clone of that value.
/// The future returned from an Eventual::resolve() can also be awaited on to wait until all instances have been completed

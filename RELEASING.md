# Veilid Release Process

## Introduction

This guide outlines the process for releasing a new version of Veilid. The end result is an update of the Deb/RPM package repositories, Crates.io, and Pypi.

## Create a Gitlab Release

Releases happen via a CI/CD pipeline. The release process flows as follows:

1. Complete outstanding merge requests (MR):

    1.1 Evaluate the MR's adherence to the published requirements and if tests pass.

    1.2 (Optional) Perform the merge in a local dev environment if testing is required beyond the standard Earthly tests.

    1.3 If everything checks out, MR meets the published requirements, and tests passed, execute the merge functions in the Gitlab UI.

    1.4 WAIT FOR A PERIOD OF 48 HOURS for a code freeze on `main`. This ensures nightly builds are deployed correctly and upgrades are successful.

2. Maintainer performs version bump:

    2.1 Update your local copy of `main` to mirror the newly merged upstream `main`

    2.2 Ensure the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) is updated and committed.

    2.3 Activate your bumpversion Python venv (see bumpversion setup section for details)

    2.4 Execute version_bump.sh with the appropriate parameter (patch, minor, or major). This results in all version entries being updated and a matching git tag created locally.

    2.5 Add all changes `git add .`

    2.6 Git commit the changes with the following message: `Version update: v{current_version} → v{new_version}`

    2.7 Create the Git tag `git tag v{new_version}`

    2.8 Push your local the tagged code to trigger the release pipeline `git push -o ci.skip && git push --tags`

    2.9 Ensure the package/release/distribute pipeline autostarts in the Gitlab UI and monitor for failures

Git tags serve as a historical record of what repo versions were released at which version numbers.

## Publish to crates.io (Manual steps if needed)

1. Configure the crates.io credentials, if not already accomplished.
2. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-tools --dry-run`
3. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-tools`
4. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-core --dry-run`
5. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-core`
6. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-remote-api --dry-run`
7. Execute `cargo publish -p veilid-remote-api`

## Publish to Pypi (Manual steps if needed)

1. Change directory to veilid-python
2. Install uv and configure the Pypi credentials, if not already accomplished.
3. Execute `uv build`
4. Execute `uv publish`

## Reverting Releases

Occasionally a release will happen that needs to be reverted. This is done manually on `crates.io` or the APT repository, or wherever the artifacts end up. Tags are not removed.

### Flutter Plugins

- [ ] __veilid-flutter__

### Version Numbering

All versions of Veilid Rust crates as well as `veilid-python` and `veilid-flutter` packages are versioned using Semver. Versions can differ per crate and package, and it is important for the Semver rules to be followed (<https://semver.org/>):

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

The `version_bump.sh` script should be run on every release to stable. All of the Rust crates are versioned together and should have the same version, as well as the `veilid-python` Python package and `veilid-flutter` Flutter plugin.

## Bumpversion Setup and Usage

### Install Bumpversion

1. Create a Python venv for bumpversion.py. Mine is in my home dir so it persists when I update my local Veilid `main`.

    `python3 -m venv ~/bumpversion-venv`
2. Activate the venv. `source ~/bumpversion-venv/bin/activate`
3. Install bumpversion. `pip3 install bumpversion`

### Activate venv for version bumping step of the release process

1. Activate the venv. `source ~/bumpversion-venv/bin/activate`
2. Return to step 2.4 of _Create a Gitlab Release_

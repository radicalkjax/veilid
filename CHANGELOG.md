**Changed in Veilid 0.5.7**

- veilid-core:
  - SECURITY: Deadlock on remote connection flood fixed in `ConnectionManager`. Thanks to quikchaos for the report. The PoC will be included in the `doc/security/poc` folder after the patched version is deployed.
  - HPKE (RFC 9180, base mode) added as `hpke_seal`/`hpke_open` on `CryptoSystem` and all bindings. Implemented for `VLD0` and `NONE` cryptosystems
  - `PublicKey`/`SecretKey` are now explicitly intended to be signing keys (VLD0: Ed25519, VLD1: ML-DSA). New types created for HPKE: `EncapsulationKey`/`DecapsulationKey`/`KemKeyPair` (VLD0: DHKEM-X25519, VLD1: ML-KEM), generated with `generate_kem_keypair` or derived from signing keys via the VLD0-only `encapsulation_key_from_signing_key`/`decapsulation_key_from_signing_secret` bridges
  - `NONE` cryptosystem brought in line with the `CryptoSystem` contract for debugging/testing
  - Crypto unit tests split per suite, enhanced with data-size sweeps, documented-error coverage, and RFC 9180 known-answer tests
  - Numerous route and fanout performance improvements

**Changed in Veilid 0.5.6**

- Optimizations:
  - veilid-wasm and veilid-flutter WASM blob size greatly reduced (-47%)
  - veilid-server 50% smaller, same great taste
  - Duplicated crates consolidated
  - Compile times improved
  - Improved CI build support

- veilid-core:
  - Capnp updated 0.25 -> 0.26
  - Macros introduced in veilid-core to visually improve API functions and strip pasted boilerplate
  - `debug-api` feature added to remove the `debug()` command. Enabled by default with velid-remote-api
    and during all debug builds. Disabled by default for release wasm32 builds.
  - `backtrace` support removed for wasm32 builds due to lack of upstream functionality and wasted space.

- veilid-tools:
  - Absorbed unmaintained crates forks: 'igd', 'stop_token', 'tracing_wasm', 'bugsalot'. Stripped out functionality we don't use. 

- veilid-cli:
  - Forks of `cursive` and related crates eliminated in favor of mainline

**Changed in Veilid 0.5.5**

- Bug Fix Release:
  - Direct replies were broken, resulting in bootstrap failures on nodes with new IP addresses
  - Build failures due to confusing cargo feature unification issues affected simple programs linking in the `veilid-core` rust crate
- Smoketest added for all published crates, testing the most-common, simple, non-veilid-workspace build configurations
  - Cargo feature unification bug reproduced with smoketest on 0.5.4, and is gone in this build.
  - Flutter builds for Windows now use compatible linker options and debug CRT for debug builds. `veilid_integration_test` package now uses Veilid-maintained fork of `xterm` package.

**Changed in Veilid 0.5.4**

- Breaking API Changes:
  - `AttachmentState` enum values have changed to eliminate `OverAttached` state
  - `VeilidUpdate::Attachment` now includes much more visibility into actual attachment conditions and network size estimations
  - Internal per-node RPC statistics removed from `PeerStats` due to excessive verbosity and lack of utility at the API level
  - `footgun` feature renamed to `footgun-nodeid-target`
  - Many `VeilidConfig` settings moved behind the new `footgun-config` option to new `VeilidConfigInternal` struct
  - `Sequencing::NoPreference` is now called `Sequencing::PreferUnordered` in preparation for eventually adding `Sequencing::EnsureUnordered`
  - Many internal API surface reductions for functions that people shouldn't have been using anyway, excessive internal-only macros, and other noise

- Global API Additions:
  - `TransactionNotFound` added to `VeilidAPIError`

- All `VeilidConfig` (and veilid-server `Settings`) structs and fields documented
- Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is now 1.89.0
- `cargo public-api` support for API stability, via script in `scripts/update_public_api.sh` and `scripts/_check_public_api.sh`
  makes changing the public API require a conscious check to accept diffs and rejects API changes in CI otherwise
- Doc comments added for entire public API surface for `veilid-core`, `veilid-tools`, `veilid-wasm`, and `veilid-remote-api` crates, 
  as well as the `veilid-flutter` Dart bindings and `veilid-python` Python bindings
- `panic` surface reduction

- veilid-cli:
  - veilid-cli now can start when no server is running and connect to it later with the 'connect' command
  - 'change_log_level' command is now just 'log' for simplicity, but both are accepted

- veilid-server:
  - `footgun-settings` feature flag added to simplify configuration, moves dangerous-to-use settings into `core.internal`
  - Removed `--ignore-log-targets` command line option in favor of `-l`/`--log-directives` that uses the new logging `RUST_LOG`-style format
  - added `core.network.address_types` configuration field to enable only specific address types, for example: `["ipv4"]` will only enable IPv4 support in veilid-server. Leaving this blank enables all address types supported by the operating system.

- veilid-core:
  - SECURITY: Reject invalid DHT schema and value signatures on inbound set value and value change notifications, not just at get_dht_value time.
    - Credit to Mr. JDH for the security report (https://github.com/Evelynkaz)
  - Added record flush on DHT record close to ensure closed records are fully flushed to the TableStore
  - Rehydration, change inspection, and watch value notifications are now transaction-aware
  - Formatting functions moved to veilid-tools, gets garbage nobody cares about out of the public API
  - Routing domain publication improvements, better logic for dial info confirmation
  - `NetworkManager`'s `Network` abstraction is now a `PlatformNetwork` trait, implemented as `NativeNetwork` and `WasmNetwork`
  - Added relay compiler to unify how relay requirements are calculated
  - Improved address change detection
  - Improved route optimizer, routes no longer are completely reset when switching relays or publishing peer info
  - Fixed UPNP support
  - Fixes for handling SLAAC, APIPA, CLAT46/XLAT464, and earlier detection of CGNAT. Big day for acroynms.
  - Dynamic source Binding for low level protocols to ensure non-temporary addresses are used for outbound flows.
  - Added `OnlineDetector` to `NetworkManager` to enhance detecting switching networks. Things are now reactive to low level address switches rather than tick-based. Next up, OS-level subscriptions to routing table and interface table changes.
  - Improved unit tests
  - (@neequ57) Extract compression from crypto
  - (@kirks) Fix recursion limit for Rust 1.94.0
  - Update keyring-manager to 0.8.2 to fix secret-service connection problems
  - Add flush_dht_record to VeilidAPI interface
  - `NodeCount` aligned u64 type added
  - implemented TransportType and transport-level stats for nodes
  - Simplified route testing, eliminated route exhaustion problems
  - Loopback addresses added to local network routing domain to permit proxy use (such as proxychains4 + tor)
    - If you want to put a proxy in your proxy so you can proxy while you proxy:
      * Set up proxychains4 (`brew install proxychains4` and turn off DNS proxying) 
      * `proxychains4 veilid-server --set-config core.network.privacy.require_inbound_relay=true`
  - Connection table now LRUs across all protocols. Connection count maximum now applies across all connection-oriented protocols.
  - Fixed bug where `api_startup` did not remove its `ApiTracingLayer` callback upon failure.
  - Added `max_concurrent_operations` to VeilidConfigDHT to offer a simple way to cap concurrent DHT operations for automatic throttling.
  - Proper IPv6 support for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
  - Added `record purge <scope> --keys <list>` debug command option to allow purging local or remote comma-delimited lists of record keys from the record store. Bypasses the normal `record delete` mechanism that only deletes local records.

- veilid-tools:
  - Formatting cleanup across the board, primarily for debugging purposes
  - (@hamanasu_ruka) Break up monolithic unit tests
  - Async lock deadlock detection (debug-locks feature) streamlined
  - AsyncKeyedCache added to async_tools

- veilid-flutter:
  - Add `LogFixture` to `veilid_test` package
  - Dart/WASM now lives here next to Dart/FFI
  - Improved unit tests
  - Consolidation of retry logic for VeilidAPI-level operations

- veilid-wasm:
  - Dart WASM implementation moved to veilid-flutter, this now only has the Javascript/Typescript bindings
  - Improved unit tests
  - No more wasm-pack. All tests use wasm-bindgen-test / wdio directly.
  - Fixed route leak in tests
  - Switched to chromedriver for tests

**Changed in Veilid 0.5.3**

- Global Breaking Changes:
  - API Breaking Change: new syntax for `VeilidAPI::new_custom_private_route`, using `PrivateSpec`
  - Feature Breaking Change: OpenTelemetry crates no longer support async-std, so we are removing support for the `opentelemetry` feature if you choose use the `rt-async-std` feature. The `opentelemetry` feature is still available for the Tokio executor as enabled by the `rt-tokio` feature.

- veilid-core:
  - Security: 
    - Validate DH operations are contributory, ensuring DH checks for dangerous identity output

    - To upgrade, change the `log_level` parameter from a single level name (`VeilidConfigLogLevel::Debug`) to something like `"#enabled=debug`
  - `VeilidLayerFilter` now has a more flexible powerful and supports setting a default configuration in its constructor
- Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is now 1.88.0

  - Rename crypto types: [#463](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/463)
    - {CryptoBytes} -> Bare{CryptoBytes}
    - Typed{CryptoBytes} -> {CryptoBytes} [#465](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/465)
  - Handle NotInSchema:
    -  switch match alternative failures and list decode failures to `RPCError::Ignore` from `RPCError::Protocol` to keep from punishing newer nodes
    - add `.ignore_ok()` trait that makes it easy to 'soft fail' `RPCError::Ignore`
    - add `rpc_ignore_*` macros
    - canonicalize coders' handling of lengths
  - Envelope and Receipt versions are now FOURCC codes to allow for parallel development of on-the-wire protocols
  - Rename `api_startup_config` -> `api_startup`, and remove the ability to configure the VeilidAPI using a callback.

- _BREAKING API CHANGES_:
  - Eliminated DHTW capability, merged into DHTV capability, now there is only one DHT enabling/disabling capability and all operations are part of it
  - Crypto / CryptoSystem functions now use typed keys everywhere (#483)
  - Eliminated 'best' `CryptoKind` concept, crypto kinds must now be explicitly stated, otherwise upgrades of veilid-core that change the 'best' `CryptoKind` could break functionality silently.
  - Encryption is enabled by default for all DHT operations, closes [#300](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/300) (@neequ57)
  - Deprecation of WSS config and removal of Application config
  - Use `VeilidAPIError` type for `ProtectedStore` functions [#480](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/480)
  - `get_dht_record_key` moved to `VeilidAPI` from `RoutingContext`, because it does not use the network
  - `TableDBTransaction::store` and `delete` are now async
  - WASM identifier names changed to camelCase, numerous structural changes, many types are now classes, no more string marshaling

- veilid-core:
  - Hop counts removed from private routes [#466](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/466)
  - Added `SequenceOrdering` enum to represent ordering mode for protocols rather than a bool
  - `RecordKey`s are now validated on both server side and client side of DHT RPC operations, closes [#299](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/299)

  - Update keyring-manager to eliminate licensing issue
  - Added 'tick lag' detection to check for missed watch updates

  - Safety routes are now twice the length when accessing a node directly [#361](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/361)
  - DHT Transactions support now exists. Multiple subkeys over multiple records can not be operated on in a single atomic commit. [#364](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/364)
  - RecordStore and StorageManager global locks have been split into per-subkey locks allowing greater parallelism.
  - RecordStore index now has more metadata and will require a one-time 'repair' delay to the TableDB upon starting a node if it contained record data created before 0.5.0. If the node doesn't start immediately, don't panic. :)

- veilid_flutter:
  - Android NDK version requirement is now 28.2.13676358
  - Android Gradle version is now 8.13.2

- veilid-python:
  - Migrated to 'uv' from 'poetry'

- veilid-server:
  - Improved ergonomics for `--dump-txt-record`, `--generate-key-pairs`, and `--set-key-pairs`

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.8**

- _BREAKING API CHANGES_:
  - set_dht_value now accepts a new flag called `allow_offline`, which defaults to `true`.
    - The previous `writer: Option<KeyPair>` argument position is now `options: Option<SetDHTValueOptions>`
    - This will only be a breaking change for anyone utilizing the previous `writer` argument.
    - `writer` is now a member of `SetDHTValueOptions`, alongside the new `allow_offline` property.

- veilid-core:
  - Add private route example
  - Add `require_inbound_relay` option in VeilidConfig. Default is false, but if enabled, forces OutboundOnly/InboundRelay mode. Can be used as an extra layer of IP address obscurity for some threat models. (@neequ57)
  - Fix crash when peer info has missing or unsupported node ids
  - Add 'auto' mode for detect_address_changes
  - Improved `TypedXXX` conversion traits, including to and from `Vec<u8>`
  - Ensure utf8 replacement characters are never emitted in logs
  - Export `CRYPTO_KIND_VLD0` constant

- veilid-python:
  - Correction of type hints
  - Fixed transaction `__aexit__` to properly rollback transaction if not committed, and not raise an exception

- veilid-server:
  - Use `detect_address_changes: auto` by default

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.7**

- _BREAKING API CHANGES_:
  - Improve type-safety by splitting out type aliases for `FourCC` and `CryptoKey` types into distinct "newtypes". Previously all instances of these types we just type aliases, and could be used interchangeably when in reality they aren't interchangeable. This prevents developers from accidentally passing the wrong type into the API, such as a `SecretKey` when you meant to pass a `PublicKey`. Function signatures have been updated to use the correct types, so code will need to be updated accordingly.
    - `FourCC` has been separated into:
      - `CryptoKind`
      - `VeilidCapability`
    - `CryptoKey` has been separated into:
      - `PublicKey`
      - `SecretKey`
        - This was also renamed from `Secret` -> `SecretKey`, as well as the associated `TypedSecretKey` and `TypedSecretKeyGroup`.
      - `Signature`
      - `Nonce`
      - `HashDigest`
      - `RouteId`
      - `RecordKey` (New) - represents a DHT Record Key
      - `NodeId` (New)
    - Note: Right now veilid-wasm is not benefiting from the type-safety yet We are looking at improving this in the future.
  - Remove a number of unintentional exports from `veilid-core`:
    - `veilid_core::vld0` module - Use the functions exported by `VeilidAPI.crypto()` instead.
      - `veilid_core::vld0::vld0_generate_keypair` 
      - `veilid_core::vld0::CryptoSystemVLD0`
      - `veilid_core::vld0::CRYPTO_KIND_VLD0`
    - Other internals that were not intended for API consumers:
      - `veilid_core::RoutingContextUnlockedInner`
      - `veilid_core::veilid_capnp`
      - `veilid_core::Envelope`
      - `veilid_core::Receipt`
      - `veilid_core::Crypto`
  - The "JSON API" that was exported by `veilid-core` has now been moved into its own crate called [`veilid-remote-api`](https://crates.io/crates/veilid-remote-api).

- veilid-core:
  - Update KeyValueDB to 0.1.3
  - Inspect watched records for value changes made while offline when coming back online
  - Additional table store unit test
  - Eliminate `unwrap()` in `best_node_id()` (fixes crash)

- veilid-tools:
  - Add `HashAtom<>` type for hashing references by identity

- veilid-flutter:
  - Fix exception handling for WASM

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.6**

- Updated pinned Rust version to 1.86

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.5**

- Update capnproto version to 1.1.0
- *BREAKING API CHANGE*:
  - watch_dht_values() now returns a bool rather than an expiration timestamp. Expiration renewal is now managed by veilid-core internally. Apps no longer need to renew watches!
  - inspect_dht_record() and cancel_dht_watch() now take an Option<ValueSubkeyRangeSet> instead of just a ValueSubkeyRangeSet, to make things easier for automatic binding generation someday and to remove ambiguities about the semantics of the default empty set.
  - DHTRecordReport now uses a `Vec<Option<ValueSubkey>>` for seq lists, rather than using the 'ValueSubkey::MAX' sentinel value (0xFFFFFFFF) to represent a missing subkey
  - Renamed config structs to better describe their purpose, and remove "Inner" from a struct that's being exposed via the API. [!402](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/402)
    - `VeilidConfig` -> `VeilidStartupOptions`
    - `VeilidConfigInner` -> `VeilidConfig`
  - Gate insecure capabilities behind the new `footgun` feature flag [#394](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/394), which is disabled by default. [!400](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/400)
    - Calling `app_call` or `app_message` with a `NodeId` target will throw an error. Use a `PrivateRoute` target instead.
    - Creating an `Unsafe` routing context will throw and error. Use `Safe` routing context instead.
    - Any AppCall or AppMessage sent from a direct NodeId will not be received.

- veilid-core:
  - **Security** Signed bootstrap v1 added which closes [#293](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/293)
  - Allow shutdown even if tables are closed
  - New, more robust, watchvalue implementation
  - Consensus is now counted from the nodes closest to the key, excluding attempts that have failed, but including new nodes that show up, requiring N out of the M closest nodes to have succeeded and all have been attempted.
  - Watching a node now also triggers an background inspection+valueget to detect if values have changed online
  - Fanout queue disqualifaction for distance-based rejections reimplemented
  - Local rehydration implemented. DHT record subkey data that does not have sufficient consensus online is re-pushed to keep it alive when records are opened.
  - Direct bootstrap v0 now filters out Relayed nodes correctly
  - Closed issue [#400](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/400)
  - Closed issue [#377](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/377)
  - Add the `veilid_features()` API, which lists the compile-time features that were enabled when `veilid-core` was built (available in language bindings as well). [#401](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/400)
  - When `veilid-core` starts up, log the version number, and the compile-time features that were enabled when it was built. [#401](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/400)
  - Closed issue [#448](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/448)

- veilid-server:
  - Put tokio-console behind a feature flag. Closed issue [#274]( https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/274)
  - Fixed 'daemon' mode `-d` option. Closed issue [#360](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/issues/360)

- veilid-wasm:
  - **Breaking** Properly generate TypeScript types for `ValueSubkeyRangeSet`, which would previously resolve to `any`. This is breaking since it can cause type errors to correctly surface in existing applications. [!397](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/397)
  - **Breaking** `startupCore()` and `defaultConfig()` now use config objects instead of stringified JSON.
    - `veilidClient.startupCore(callback, JSON.stringify(config))` now becomes `veilidClient.startupCore(callback, config)`. [!402](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/402)
    - `JSON.parse(veilidClient.defaultConfig())` is now `veilidClient.defaultConfig()`
    - The `VeilidConfigInner` type is now `VeilidConfig`.
  - Expose the isShutdown API: [#392](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/392)

- CI:
  - Ensure Cargo.lock is up-to-date during CI pipelines

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.3**

This release exists without changes to the Veilid codebase in order to test fixes to the CI/CD release pipeline.

- CI/CD
  - Fixed broken RPM packaging

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.2**

veilid-core:
- (neequ57) Merged !330 - geolocation feature (off by default) to allow excluding/denylisting route nodes based on geography
- (evelyn) Merged !267 - adding the ability to create dht records with a specified owner key (rust only currently)
- (rivka segan) Merged !335 - fix logic error that used wss when not tls
- New startup/shutdown initialization and component system
- Logs are tagged with the program_name+namespace they are collected in
  - No more per-facility log macros, one unified `veilid_log!()` macro for all events
  - Switch between subnodes in veilid-cli switches which logs you're viewing
  - All global logs and subnode 0 go to console, all other subnodes are accessible via veilid-cli
- Major refactor to add VeilidComponentRegistry as the 'owner' of all components
  - Access to components now uses scoped guards for lifetime management rather than loose Arc clones
  - VeilidComponent trait makes adding common per-component functions easier
  - Unified initialize, post-initialize, pre-terminate, and terminate phase harness
- AsyncCryptoSystemGuard added to make heavy operations happier in async environments
- UDP hole punch needed TTL setting to keep routers from incorrectly making conntracks
- Public address detection was getting stuck in a lock contention, regression from refactor
- PeerInfo caching to eliminate some repeated cloning
- NodeContactMethod cache improvements
- Symmetric NAT and NetworkClass::OutboundOnly were broken. When routing domain address types are known, but there is no dialinfo, that should be OutboundOnly and not Invalid. It's valid to have no dialinfo. Added network class 'confirmation'.

veilid-tools:
- replaced deprecated serde_yaml crate with maintained serde_yaml_ng crate
- Start of VirtualRouter network virtualization
  - standalone virtual router binary in veilid-tools (`cargo run --bin virtual_router`)

- You can now run multiple subnodes concurrently in the same process with `--subnode_count=N`
- Up to 256 concurrent each of TCP and WebSocket connections now, up from 32
- Turn off detect_address_changes and upnp by default

veilid-wasm:
- (bgrift) Merged [!352](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/352) - WASM supports owner on createDhtRecord, also added the getDhtRecordKey function
  - Breaking change: [!352](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/352)

- MR [!328](https://gitlab.com/veilid/veilid/-/merge_requests/328) 'tiny improvements'

**Changed in Veilid 0.4.0**

- RFC-0001: Constrain DHT Subkey Size, issue #406

- DialInfo detection issues:
  - Add a publish() as well as a commit() for routing domain editor
  - Should only publish our peer info after we're sure we done editing it (end of public address detection task)
  - Publish should happen after relay selection as well
  - Publish should happen if the relay's PeerInfo has changed
  - Publish should not do anything if the PeerInfo hasn't changed
  - `PeerInfo` -> `Arc<PeerInfo>` everywhere to minimize deep clones and ensure read-only PeerInfo
  - Routing domain editing is now more atomic
  - When a node selects a relay it now immediately protects its connections.
  - Made dial info port (for port restricted nat) more resilient to changes, in the case there are multiple mappings
  - Relays that drop protected connections should be deprioritized for relay selection (table saturation detection)
  - clear_network_callback in do_public_dial_info_check is a kludge, removed
  - Raised the bar for DialInfo changes when its just the port
  - Pinging node on the same network works again
  - resolve_node() never returns a dead node even when we want to try to communicate with it again
  - Removed 'bad public address' detection as it wasn't working anyway
  - Added separate parallelism lanes for relay keepalive pings from peer liveness check pings, as they are higher priority
  - Change send_data to always check cache for contact method first instead of going with filtered active flows first, avoids choosing UDP when a preferable TCP connection could be made
  - Nodes that are not relay capable should drop relayed packets

- DHT issues:
  - Make SetValue more likely to succeed by accepting a GetValue consensus if a full SetValue consensus is not reached.
  - Offline subkey writes are cleared too fast and should be thought as 'subkeys not yet synchronized'
  - If set_value is partial / in-flight, it should still be in offline_subkey_writes
  - Make inflight_subkey_writes list and probably some bit for 'written_while_inflight' so we don't clear the offline_subkey_writes until they're really written

- Networking:
  - Fix TIME_WAIT states on Windows
  - Attempt to give priority to relaying flows

- UI:
  - Make veilid-cli display the connection state when reconnecting, and exit more cleanly on ctrl-c
  - Added 'uptime' veilid-cli debug command

- Misc:
  - Fixes for python DHT test

- API Additions:
  - VeilidConfigInner::new parameterization for easier config from rust apps
  - Remove veilid-server specific paths from veilid-core defaults
  - Lots more stats about node performance in PeerStats
  - Uptime stats in VeilidStateAttachment/VeilidUpdateAttachment, issue #317

**Changed in Veilid 0.3.4**
- Crates updates
  - Update crates to newer versions
  - Remove veilid-async-tungstenite and veilid-async-tls crates as they are no longer needed
- Fix startup/shutdown/attach/detach
  - Improved resource accounting
  - Locked startup/shutdown mechanism
  - Perfetto profiler output for ui.perfetto.dev
  - SO_LINGER(0) re-enabled to eliminate TIME_WAIT on restart/detach/attach
  (this may cause noise for WASM in browsers when websockets are RST dropped rather than handshake closed, we will deal with this later)
- _Community Contributions_
  - prototype script to install / run a veilid-server node within a UnifyOS device (tested on a unify dream machine pro SE) @Vyrus-001

**Changed in Veilid 0.3.3**
- Fix set_dht_value and watch_value
  - Watching values incorrectly categorized 'owner' keys as anonymous watchers
  - Setting a dht value with the same sequence number as what is on the network, but with a conflicting value, did not result in the current value being returned to the api caller as it should have been
- DHT cleanup
  - Proper application of DHT capabilities
  - Fanout debugging log target
  - Performance measurement / timing of veilid_api log target
- Fix DHT Rust integration test
- ValueChanged Optional
  - Allow value changed data to be optional in rpc schema

**Changed in Veilid 0.2.5**
- API BREAKING CHANGES: 
  - on `RoutingContext`: `with_privacy()` renamed to `with_default_safety()`
  - on `RoutingContext`: `with_custom_privacy()` renamed to `with_safety()`
  - on `RoutingContext`: `safety()` method added that returns the current `SafetySelection`
  - Routing contexts are now safety-route-enabled by default. To disable, use `with_safety()` with `SafetySelection::Unsafe`.
- WASM now works better with updated connection manager code
- Async-std flavor of veilid-core now builds correctly again
- Safety route allocation is bidirectional
- Connection table LRU cache now has protection for relays and in-use RPC question/answers
- Dead route notifications are now sent only for manually allocated routes
- Allocated routes that fail tests now have their nodes marked as 'failure to send' so they go 'unreliable' and get re-tested. Also the same route will not immediately be reallocated as a result.
- DHT tests ported from Python to Rust
- Rustls updated to latest release
- Protected connections (such as relays) that drop result in marking the node as 'failure to send' so a different relay gets chosen
